2 ) How to embed audio and video in a webpage?

=> The <audio> tag is used to embed sound content in a document, such as music or other audio streams.

The <audio> tag contains one or more <source> tags with different audio sources. The browser will choose the first source it supports.

The text between the <audio> and </audio> tags will only be displayed in browsers that do not support the <audio> element.

There are three supported audio formats in HTML: MP3, WAV, and OGG.



3 ) Semantic element in HTML5?

=>A semantic element clearly describes its meaning to both the browser and the developer.

Examples of non-semantic elements: <div> and <span> - Tells nothing about its content.

Examples of semantic elements: <form>, <table>, and <article> - Clearly defines its content.


 4 )  Canvas and SVG tags


  = >   SVG is a language for describing 2D graphics in XML. Canvas draws 2D graphics, on the fly (with a JavaScript). SVG is XML based, which means that every element is available within the SVG DOM. You can attach JavaScript event handlers for an element. In SVG, each drawn shape is remembered as an object.
